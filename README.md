# Pay Rate Calculutor

Small android app to show my mom that she is seriously underpaid at her convience on her phone.

Converts salary to hourly and vice versa.

Example Use Case

Realator is working 12 hr days and making $2,000 a month plus possible commision. Commission odds are low. App shows realator that she would make the same amount for less than $5/hr.

UPDATE: Realator is now employed elsewhere.
